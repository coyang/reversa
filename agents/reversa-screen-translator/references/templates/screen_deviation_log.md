# Screen Deviation Log

> Record of every divergence between the legacy and the spec generated in `target_screens.md`. Append-only. Pending deviations block handoff to the Inspector.
> Approved deviations are propagated to `parity_specs.md § Exceptions` when the Inspector runs.

## Conventions

- **ID**: `DEV-NNN` (sequential, three digits).
- **Type**:
  - `technical`: target technical limitation (e.g., Windows terminal without UTF-8 without `chcp 65201`).
  - `modernization`: intentional divergence resulting from modernized mode.
  - `platform`: divergence forced by platform incompatibility (e.g., Win16 → web).
  - `correction`: legacy visual bug that the target corrects (e.g., typo in label).
- **Approval**: `pending` | `approved` | `rejected`.
- Deviation `approved` → also listed in `parity_specs.md § Exceptions`.
- Deviation `pending` → blocks handoff to Inspector.
- Deviation `rejected` → archived with explicit note; agent regenerates the screen in conformant mode.
