  Creates interactive and professional data visualizations using Highcharts.js, generating
  standalone HTML with animated, responsive, and accessible charts. Use this skill whenever
  the user asks to create charts, dashboards, data visualizations, or any visual
  representation of numerical/categorical data. It should be used when the user mentions
  terms like "chart", "dashboard", "highcharts", "data visualization",
  "line chart", "bar chart", "pie chart", "scatter", "heatmap", "treemap", "gauge", "stock chart",
  "map", "gantt", "sankey", "funnel", or when providing data (CSV, JSON, table, spreadsheet)
  requesting a visual representation. It should also be activated when the user asks for
  beautiful, interactive, animated charts with tooltips, drill-down, or export capabilities.
  Works with inline data, CSV, JSON, and data files. Always generates a complete, functional
  standalone HTML file.

## Language contract

Read `.reversa/state.json` fields `chat_language` and `doc_language`. Apply the same rules as the orchestrator:
- If `chat_language` is `zh-cn`: all conversational output in 简体中文.
- If `doc_language` is `中文`: all generated spec artifacts in Chinese. Keep English for code identifiers, file paths, API endpoints, and technical terms per GLOSSARY.zh.md.
- If other values: match the declared language.
- When `chat_language` and `doc_language` differ, respect each independently.


# Highcharts Visualizer

Creates professional data visualizations using Highcharts.js. Always generates **standalone HTML**
(single, self-contained file) with interactive, animated, responsive, and accessible charts.

## Workflow

### 1. Receive the Data

Data can come from:

- **Inline in the conversation** — User pastes data, table, list of values
- **CSV/JSON file** — Analyze the content using `view_file` and inject the data directly into the generated HTML. Never create Python scripts.
- **Excel spreadsheet** — Extract data from tables and inject it into the HTML. Do not use Python.
- **Sample data** — When the user wants to explore a chart type without real data
- **Data URL** — Use `web_fetch` to fetch remote data

### 2. Analyze the Data

Before generating the chart, understand the nature of the data:

- **Dimensions**: how many series? How many categories? Temporal or categorical?
- **Scale**: range of values, outliers, distribution
- **Relationships**: comparison, composition, distribution, trend, correlation
- **Volume**: few points (<100), medium (100-10K), large (>10K — use boost module)

Analyze the data internally after reading and inject tags via string. Do not create intermediate Python programs.

### 3. Choose the Chart Type

Consult `references/CHART_CATALOG.md` for the complete catalog of 40+ chart types,
with guidance on when to use each one.

**Quick decision rule:**

| Goal | Recommended types |
|------|-------------------|
| Trend over time | line, area, spline, areaspline |
| Comparison between categories | column, bar, lollipop, bullet |
| Composition / proportion | pie, donut, stacked column, stacked area, treemap, sunburst |
| Distribution | histogram, box plot, scatter, bell curve |
| Correlation | scatter, bubble, heatmap |
| Flow / process | sankey, dependency wheel, network graph |
| Hierarchy | treemap, sunburst, organization chart |
| Geographic | map (Highcharts Maps module) |
| Financial / timeline | stock chart (candlestick, OHLC, flags) |
| Progress / KPI | gauge, solid gauge, activity gauge |
| Project / planning | gantt chart |
| Funnel / conversion | funnel, pyramid |

If the user did not specify the type, suggest 2-3 options that best represent the data.

### 4. Generate the Code

Consult `references/HIGHCHARTS_PATTERNS.md` for tested code patterns.

**Fundamental rules:**

1. **Standalone HTML**: single `.html` file. When run by the Reversa Docs Team, Highcharts comes from `assets/vendor/` (downloaded by the Publisher via `vendor-pins.yaml`). When run standalone, CDN is accepted as a fallback but the preferred path is local.
2. **Pinned version**: `highcharts@11.4.8`. Core and modules must be the same version.
3. **Modules on demand**: only include extra scripts when necessary (see modules table).
4. **Accessibility always**: always include `assets/vendor/highcharts-accessibility.js`.
5. **Exporting always**: always include `assets/vendor/highcharts-exporting.js`.
6. **Responsive**: the chart must adapt to the container/viewport.
7. **Consistent theme**: apply cohesive colors and professional typography.
8. **Animation**: enable entry animations and smooth transitions.
9. **Rich tooltips**: formatted tooltips with units and context.
10. **Large data**: for >10K points, include `modules/boost.js` (must be added to `vendor-pins.yaml`).
11. **No `fetch()` for local files**: data comes from `window.RV_DATA.metrics` (or `window.RV_DATA.timeline`), loaded by `assets/js/data.js`.

**Required modules by chart type (preference: local path in `assets/vendor/`):**

| Resource | Local (when run by the Docs team) | CDN Fallback |
|----------|-----------------------------------|--------------|
| Core (required) | `assets/vendor/highcharts.js` | `https://code.highcharts.com/11.4.8/highcharts.js` |
| Accessibility (required) | `assets/vendor/highcharts-accessibility.js` | `.../11.4.8/modules/accessibility.js` |
| Exporting (required) | `assets/vendor/highcharts-exporting.js` | `.../11.4.8/modules/exporting.js` |
| Treemap | `assets/vendor/highcharts-treemap.js` | `.../11.4.8/modules/treemap.js` |
| Sankey | `assets/vendor/highcharts-sankey.js` | `.../11.4.8/modules/sankey.js` |
| Timeline | `assets/vendor/highcharts-timeline.js` | `.../11.4.8/modules/timeline.js` |
| Others (Sunburst, Heatmap, Funnel, etc) | add to `vendor-pins.yaml` before using | `.../11.4.8/modules/<module>.js` |
| Stock (candlestick, OHLC) | add to `vendor-pins.yaml` before using | `.../stock/11.4.8/highstock.js` |
| Maps | add to `vendor-pins.yaml` before using | `.../maps/11.4.8/highmaps.js` |
| Gantt | add to `vendor-pins.yaml` before using | `.../gantt/11.4.8/highcharts-gantt.js` |

> If a page needs a module that is **not yet** in `vendor-pins.yaml`, the correct approach is:
> 1. Ask the Publisher to add the pin (commit in this skill or open an issue), with primary URL + fallbacks.
> 2. Only then use the module.
> Pointing directly to CDN in final pages breaks the invariant "works via `file://` without internet".

All CDNs (fallback) in the format: `https://code.highcharts.com/11.4.8/{path}`.

### 5. Save and Deliver

Save the generated HTML directly to the destination folder using `write_to_file`. Always generate pure HTML with all data processed and injected into `<script>` variables. Do not use Python snippets.

## Quality Guidelines

- **Professional aesthetics**: cohesive colors (use Highcharts palettes or custom), clean typography, appropriate spacing
- **Formatted data**: numbers with thousand separators, localized dates, units on axes
- **Clear legends**: descriptive series names, position that does not obstruct data
- **Rich interactivity**: hover highlights, contextual tooltips, zoom when applicable
- **Dark mode**: when appropriate, offer a dark version with `backgroundColor: '#1a1a2e'`
- **Multiple charts**: for dashboards, organize in responsive CSS grid
- **Commented code**: comments in English explaining each section

## Error Handling

Consult `references/ERRORS.md` for error scenarios and solutions.
